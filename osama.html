              In 2006 he briefly came out of retirement to advise on a complicated procedure<br> which
              required removing a transplant heart from a patient whose own heart had recovered.<br>
              The patient's original heart had not been removed during transplant surgery nearly a<br>

He is also notable for saving many lives by pioneering a technique for 'switching' the heart vessels of babies born with transposition of the great arteries, a congenital heart defect in which the two major vessels carrying blood out of the heart, the aorta and the pulmonary artery, are switched.
In 1994 he founded the charity Chain in Hope (www.chainofhope.org). This charity aims to provide children suffering from life-threatening disease with the corrective surgery and treatment to which they do not have access.
Among celebrities whose lives he extended was the comedian Eric Morecambe. He was also known to have treated the famous Egyptian actor Omar Sharif, urging the latter to give up the cigarettes that had led to his heart attack.
In 2002, he was selected to head a government recruitment drive for overseas doctors.
He has had a house named after him at The Petchey Academy which opened in September 2006.
He is one of few masters and teachers in the world of the highly technically demanding "Ross Procedure".
He established the Aswan Heart Center in April 2009.
