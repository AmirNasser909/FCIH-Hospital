        <h1 style="text-align: center">Ibn Sina In Medicine</h1>
        <h2 class="h">Overview</h2>
        <p>The Sheikh al-Ra'is Sharaf al-mulk Abu 'Ali al-Husayn b. 'Abd Allah b. 'al-Hassan b. 'Ali Ibn Sina, in Latin he is
         Know as Avicenna and his most famous Works are those on philosophy and medicine. His philosophical views
         have engaged the attention of Western thinkers over several centuries, and his books have been among the
         most important sources in philosophy. in medicine, his encyclpedic book, al-Qanun (The Canon) - Al Qanun Fi
         Al-Tibb (The Canon of Medicine)- Was translated into Latin towards the end of the twelfth century CE, and
         became a reference source for medical studies in the universities df Europe until the end of the seventeenth
         century.</p>

        <p>[Ibn Sina, or Avicenna, lived in Hamadan and Jurjan from 980 to 1037 CE,
         and acquired great fame in mediaeval European medicine].</p>
        <p>In al-Qanun, Ibn Sina basically followed the methodical, analytical line
         originated by al-Razi. Al-Qanun Was, however, more broadly<br> conceived
         than Al-Hawi(the Continens and included all branches of medical science).</p>
        <p>According to Desons, most of the disesaes of the kidneys and bladder can
         be recognized in the systemic classification of renal diseases and the
         accounts of bladder diseases given by Ibn Sina in al-Qanun. He was also
         the first to point out the fact that haematuria may be due to causes outside
         the urinary system, for example, blood diseases.</p>
        
        <p>Apart from the methodical classification and precise descriptions of aetiological factors and signs in his chapter on urinary disturbances, Ibn
          ina pointed out the role of psychological factors in the treatment of certain cases of nocturnal nuresis.</p>
         
        <p>Both Ibn Sina and al-Razi warned against catheterization in the presence of inflammation, as it increases the swelling and pain. To ensure gentle
         catheterisation, Ibn Sina designed catheters with rounded, firm tips and many side holes from the skin of certain marine and other animals.</p>
        
        <p>The al-Hawi, at-Tasrif and al-Qanun were translated into Latin as early as 1150 CE by Gerard of Cremona and greatly influenced the European Mediaeval
         schools of medicine well into the eighteenth century.</p>

        <h2 class="h">The Teacher</h2>
        <p>Ibn Sina has attracted the attention of scholars, past and present, who have written books, treatises and articles on him. One of these aspects, however,<br>
        has not been very widely discussed, namely his views on education.</p>
        
        <p>Although Ibn Sina's writings on this subject, in comparison with his vast output on other subjects, are in fact considered to be very scarce, we do nonetheless find
         he deals with the same problems that confront educators today. He speaks about humanity, society, knowledge and ethics. He devoted a treatise entitled ‘Politics' to
         education; and he speaks at some length in ‘The Canon' about the upbringing of infants. Thereby, Ibn Sina represents a lively illustration of the meeting between
         philosophy and education, for the educator and the philosopher are both faced with the same problems: truth, goodness, the nature of the world, the meaning of knowledge
         and human nature, and so on. Obviously, Ibn Sina the philosopher has his own views on education. In addition, if we consider that Ibn Sina undertook teaching on a
         practical level for a considerable length of time, we realize that we have here a thinker whose philosophy was transformed into an educational theory that he himself
         practiced.</p>

         <p>The human being, in Ibn Sina's view, consists of both hidden (sirr) and open (‘alan) elements. Known to us is the perceptible human body with its organs and its cells.
         ‘Sensory perception stops at its exterior, while anatomy (dissection) enables us to learn about the interior; the hidden part consists of the powers of its mind. These
         mental powers motivate the human being, and cause it to carry out its various activities and behave as a human being'. To Ibn Sina, the human is a tangible body on the
         outside, revealed within by means of anatomy as we see in his books, such as Al-Qanun (The Canon) and we do not find any difficulty today in accepting this. We still
         have to look at the mental powers or faculties that motivate this body</p>

        <img src="ibn-sina-04.jpg" width=350 height=500 alt="image">
        
        <p>This lasts from the third to the fifth year, at the time when ‘the child's body strengthens, his tongue is free, and he is ready for instruction, and his hearing is attentive'.
         In ‘The Canon', he defines the start of the sixth year as the end of that stage, whereupon he enters ‘the stage of primary teaching'. Ibn Sina says: ‘And when he has reached
         the age of 6 years, he should be brought to the tutor and the teacher'. We see Ibn Sina not concerned here with any specific kind of teaching, but merely with creating a happy
         childhood as regards physical, mental and moral health. </p>

        <h2 class="h">The Doctor</h2>
        <p>The seventh and last art mentioned in the fourth book of the Canon is assigned to the topic of "zina" ("ziynet" in Turkish), that is physical appearance. It consists of four
         articles. Although the term "zina" calls to mind ornament and ornamentation, when we take a look at the text in the Canon, we may observe that it deals with appearance. That is
         to say the hair and body care; as well as skin diseases and their treatment. What is more, it also refers to subjects such as obesity and emaciation that affect the appearance,
         and preventive methods and measures for all of these are discussed.</p>

        <p>This article is based on the Turkish version of the Canon. It is important to note however, Mustafa b. Ahmed b. Huseyin of Tokat, who translated it into Turkish, in the 18th 
        century, often used medical Arabic terminology and some idioms that may not be found in most contemporary Ottoman dictionaries. It is a literal translation, yet most of the terms
        of Arabic origin that are found in it have different meanings from those of today. For this reason, in order to comprehend thoroughly the medicine of Ibn Sina, we must first perform
        an exhaustive study of the meanings of the medical terms used in the medical literature of the period. Only after this may we wholly understand the old medical texts. If we cannot
        aptly comment on the theories regarding the etymology of illnesses or, in other terms, the "philosophy of medicine", I believe that it will be impossible to thoroughly comprehend
        ancient medicine.</p>

        <h2 class="h">In Encyclopaedia Britannica</h2>
        <p><q>Despite a general assessment favouring al-Rāzī’s medical contributions, many physicians historically preferred Avicenna for his organization and clarity. Indeed, his influence
        over Europe’s great medical schools extended well into the early modern period. There The Canon of Medicine (Al-Qānūn fī al-ṭibb) became the preeminent source, rather than al-Rāzī’s
         Kitāb al-ḥāwī (Comprehensive Book).</q> <a class="d" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/45755/Avicenna/516/Influence-in-medicine" target="_self">Britannica 1</a> <a class="e" href="http://www.britannica.com/biography/Avicenna" target="_blank">Britannica 2</a></p>
