          <h2>Diabetes mellitus: </h2>
         
          <p class="mmm">commonly referred to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period, Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger, If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications, Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death.Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h2>Signs and symptoms:</h2>
            <p class="mmm">  The classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are weight loss, polyuria (increased urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), and polyphagia (increased hunger), Symptoms may develop rapidly (weeks or months) in type 1 DM, while they usually develop much more slowly and may be subtle or absent in type 2 DM.

Several other signs and symptoms can mark the onset of diabetes although they are not specific to the disease. In addition to the known ones above, they include blurry vision, headache, fatigue, slow healing of cuts, and itchy skin. Prolonged high blood glucose can cause glucose absorption in the lens of the eye, which leads to changes in its shape, resulting in vision changes. A number of skin rashes that can occur in diabetes are collectively known as diabetic dermadromes.

</p>
            <br>
            
            <h2 style="font-size: 31px" >There are three types of diabetes:</h2>
            <h3 style="font-size: 27px">1) Type 1 diabetes</h3>
            <p class="mmm">The body does not produce insulin. Some people may refer to this type as insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile diabetes, or early-onset diabetes. People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="mmm">Patients with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin injections for the rest of their life. They must also ensure proper blood-glucose levels by carrying out regular blood tests and following a special diet.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="mmm">Between 2001 and 2009, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes among the under 20s in the USA rose 23%, according to SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth data issued by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). </p>
               
             <br>
              <h3 style="font-size: 27px">1) Type 2 diabetes</h3>
               <p class="mmm">The body does not produce enough insulin for proper function, or the cells in the body do not react to insulin (insulin resistance).
               </p>
               <br>
               <p class="mmm">Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are type 2.</p>
               <br>
               
               <br>
               <img src="diabetes-blood-test.jpg"height=300px width=400px  style="float: right"
              
               <br>
               <p class="mmm">Overweight and obese people have a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with a healthy body weight. People with a lot of visceral fat, also known as central obesity, belly fat, or abdominal obesity, are especially at risk. Being overweight/obese causes the body to release chemicals that can destabilize the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems.</p>
                 <h3 style="font-size: 27px">1) Type 3 diabetes</h3>
                 <p class="mmm"> This type affects females during pregnancy. Some women have very high levels of glucose in their blood, and their bodies are unable to produce enough insulin to transport all of the glucose into their cells, resulting in progressively rising levels of glucose.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p class="mmm">The majority of gestational diabetes patients can control their diabetes with exercise and diet. Between 10% to 20% of them will need to take some kind of blood-glucose-controlling medications. Undiagnosed or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can raise the risk of complications during childbirth. The baby may be bigger than he/she should be.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p class="mmm">Scientists from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University found that women whose diets before becoming pregnant were high in animal fat and cholesterol had a higher risk for gestational diabetes, compared to their counterparts whose diets were low in cholesterol and animal fats</p>

                 <h2>Prevention:</h2>
                 <p class="mmm">here is no known preventive measure for type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes – which accounts for 85–90% of all cases – can often be prevented or delayed by maintaining a normal body weight, engaging in physical activity, and consuming a healthy diet, Higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28%, Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole grains and fiber, and choosing good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish, Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources of saturated fat can also help prevent diabetes, Tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes and its complications, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well,

                                The relationship between type 2 diabetes and the main modifiable risk factors (excess weight, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use) is similar in all regions of the world. There is growing evidence that the underlying determinants of diabetes are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic and cultural change: globalization, urbanization, population aging, and the general health policy environment</p>

                <p class="mmm">
                   The best foods for diabetes are most often whole foods that are not processed, such as fruits and vegetables. Including these extra-healthy power foods in your diet will help you meet your nutritional needs as well as lower your risk of diabetes complications such as heart disease. Of course, the foods on this list shouldn't be the only foods you eat, but incorporating some or all into your diabetes meal plan will help improve your overall health.
