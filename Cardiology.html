        <p>Heart disease or heart disease is a comprehensive term that refers to a variety of different heart diseases . In 2007, heart disease was the leading cause of
        death in the United States [1] [2], England , Canada and Wales , [3] and 25.4% of all deaths in the United States are due to these diseases.</p>
        <h2 class="l">Types of heart disease </h2>
        
        <h3 class="l">Coronary heart disease</h3>
        <p>Coronary heart disease Coronary heart failure is meant to deliver an adequate amount of blood to the heart muscle and surrounding tissues. Individuals
        often confuse coronary heart disease with coronary artery disease , although the first may occur for other and different reasons, such as coronary angiogenesis.</p>
        <p>Coronary artery disease is an atherosclerosis caused by the accumulation of fatty platelets or plaque (porridge) inside the walls of the arteries that feed the
        heart muscle. In addition, angina (chest pain) and myocardial infarction (heart attack) are symptoms of coronary heart disease and associated disease.</p>
        <p>More than 459,000 Americans die each year from coronary heart disease [6] . In the UK , there are 101,000 deaths per year due to coronary heart disease.</p>
        <h3 class="l">Treatment</h3>
        <p>Changes in lifestyle</p>
        <p>Lifestyle changes that may be useful in coronary heart disease include:</p>
        <ul class="e">
            <li>Weight Control</li>
            <li>Quit Smoking</li>
            <li>Playing sports</li>
            <li>Healthy diet. Doctors have recommended over the past 50 years, reducing animal foods and increasing plant foods</li>
            <li>Consumption of fish oil to increase the amount of Omega</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="l">Myocardial infarction </h3>
        <p>Cardiomyopathy (Cardiomyopathy) is a term literally means "heart muscle disease"; where myo means muscle and pathy means disease. Cardiac insufficiency
        is meant to function properly for any reason. It should be noted that people with myocardial infarction are often at risk of irregular heartbeat and / or sudden cardiac death.</p>
        <p>External myocardial infarction - are pictures of cases of myocardial infarction showing the pathology of the disease any causes and symptoms outside
        the heart muscle itself. Cases of myocardial infarction often occur in this way, because ischemia or hemorrhage is one of the most common causes of
        myocardial infarction. The World Health Organization (WHO) calls for certain cases of myocardial infarction of this type  [ citation needed ] :</p>

                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Congestive myocardial infarction (DCM) - the most common form of heart disease - is one of the key signs of heart transplantation. When the disease occurs, the
                    heart (especially the left ventricle ) swells and its ability to pump blood decreases.</li>
                    <li>HCM or HOCM - a genetic disorder that is more likely to occur than a mutation in the genes responsible for coding the sarcomir proteins . In cases of this disease,
                    the thickness of the heart muscle increases, which may hinder the flow of blood, and prevents the heart from functioning properly.</li>
                    <li>The arrhythmias or arrhythmias (ARVC) are caused by an electrocardiogram, which causes the heart muscle to move into a scar tissue. The right ventricle is usually
                    the most affected part of the disease.</li>
                    <li>Congestive myocardial infarction (CRM) - the most common type of myocardial infarction. In this disease, the walls of the right ventricle and the left ventricle are
                    stiff, but may not increase their thickness, as well as they reject the normal reception of blood in the heart.</li>
                    <li>Spongiform myocardial infarction - Left ventricular walls do not grow properly since the patient was born, making them look spongy when ultrasound scans the heart.</li>

        <h3 class="l">Cardiovascular diseases</h3>
        <p>Cardiovascular diseases are a number of specific diseases that affect the heart itself and / or the vascular system, especially the veins and arteries leading to and from the
        heart. Some studies of gender differences suggest that women with cardiovascular disease usually suffer from the types that affect blood vessels in particular, whereas men usually
        suffer from muscle-influencing types The heart itself. One of the known or related causes attributed to cardiovascular disease is diabetes, high blood pressure, elevated homocysteine
        ​​and high blood cholesterol.Types of cardiovascular diseases include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Atherosclerosis</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="l">Ischemic disease</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ischemic disease - another heart disease that affects the heart itself is characterized by low amount of blood pumped by the heart of the body.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="l">Heart failure </h3>
        <p>Heart failure - also called congestive heart failure ( CHF ) and congestive heart failure ( CCF ) is a condition that can be caused by cardiac disorders related to the function
        or structure of the heart that will weaken the ability of the heart to supply the body with enough blood or pump it across The whole body. This in turn leads to impaired heart and
        body functions .</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pulmonary heart disease is a deficiency of the right side of the heart.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="l">Heart disease caused by high blood pressure </h3>
        <p>Heart disease caused by high blood pressure is a heart disease caused by high blood pressure, especially local hypertension. Diseases that can be caused by heart disease caused by
        high blood pressure include:</p>
        <ul class="g">
            <li>Left ventricular hypertrophy</li>
            <li>Left ventricular hypertrophy</li>

            <li>Arrhythmia</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="l">Inflammatory heart disease </h3>
        <p>Inflammatory heart disease includes inflammation of the heart muscle and / or surrounding tissues.</p>
        <ul class="h">
            <li>Inflammation of the lining of the heart - inflammation is the inner layer of the heart called the endocardium or internal heart lining. Heart valve is the most affected part of the
            disease.</li>
            <li>Enlarged heart Inflammatory</li>
            <li>Myocarditis is an inflammation of the myocardium which is the muscle part of the heart.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="l">Heart valve disease </h3>
        <p>Heart valve disease is a disease that affects one or more valves of the heart . There are four main valves in the heart that may be infected by this type of disease. These include the
        trigeminal valve and aortic valve on the right side of the heart, as well as the mitral valve and the aortic valve on the left side of the heart.</p>
        <h2 class="l">Symptoms</h2>
        <img src="images (2).jpg" alt="image" width=600 height=300 align="right">
        <p>The symptoms of heart disease depend on the type of heart disease that you have.</p>
        <h3 class="l">Symptoms of cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis):</h3>
        <p>Symptoms can include:</p>
        <ul class="i">
            <li>Chest pain (angina).</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
            <li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of the body are tight.</li>
            <li>Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may not be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It is important to watch cardiovascular symptoms and discuss
        concerns with your doctor. Cardiovascular disease can sometimes be found early through regular checkups.</p>
        <h3 class="l">Symptoms of heart disease caused by abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia):</h3>
        <p>Irregular heartbeat is abnormal heartbeat. Your heart may beat very quickly, very slowly or irregularly.
        Symptoms of arrhythmia may include:</p>
        <ul class="j">
            <li>Flutter in your chest.</li>
            <li>Heartbeat (arrhythmias).</li>
            <li>Slow pulse (slow heart).</li>

            <li>Fainting.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="l">Symptoms of heart disease caused by heart defects (congenital malformations):</h3>
        
        <p>Congenital heart defects are serious - defects that are born with the baby - usually become apparent immediately after birth.Symptoms of heart failure in children may include:</p>
        <ul class="k">
            <li>Pale gray or blue skin (bluish).</li>
            <li>Swelling in the legs, abdomen or areas around the eyes.</li>
            <li>In the infant, and shortness of breath during feeding, leading to a lack of weight increase the child well.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Congenital heart defects are less serious and are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during puberty.
        Signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects that are usually not immediately life-threatening include:</p>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Feeling short of breath during exercise or activity.</li>
            <li>Easily tire during exercise or activity.</li>

        <h3 class="l">Symptoms of heart disease caused by impaired myocardium (myocardial infarction):</h3>
        <p>Myocardial infarction is the thickness and stiffness of myocardium. In the early stages of myocardial infarction, you may not have any symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms
        may include:</p>
        <ol start="11">
            <li>Inability to breathe with effort or rest.</li>
            <li>Swelling in the legs, ankles and feet.</li>

            <li>Irregular heartbeat that is fast, fluttering.</li>
            <li>Dizziness, dizziness and fainting.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="l">Symptoms of heart disease caused by heart inflammation:</h3>
        <p>There are three types of heart infections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inflammation of the pericardium, which affects the surrounding tissues of the heart.</li>
            <li>Myocarditis, which affects the middle layer muscles of the walls of the heart.</li>
            <li>Endocarditis, which affects the internal membrane that separates the chambers and the heart valves.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Symptoms vary slightly with each type of infection, and symptoms of heart infection can include:</p>
        <ol reversed>

            <li>Rash or unusual spots.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="l">Symptoms of heart disease caused by heart valve diseases: </h3>
        <p>The heart contains four valves - aortic, coronary, pulmonary and triplex valves - valves may be damaged due to a variety of conditions that lead to narrowing, leakage, or improper closure.
        Symptoms depend on which valve does not work properly, and symptoms generally include:</p>
        <ul type="square">
