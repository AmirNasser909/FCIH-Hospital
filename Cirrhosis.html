damage is characterized by the replacement of normal liver tissue by scar tissue Typically, the<br>

disease worsens, a person may become tired, weak, itchy, have swelling in the lower legs, <br>
develop yellow skin, bruise easily, have fluid build up in the abdomen, or develop spider-<br>
like blood vessels on the skin The fluid build-up in the abdomen may become spontaneously <br>

Cirrhosis affected about 2.8 million people and resulted in 1.3 million deaths in 2015.  Of these, alcohol caused 348,000, 
<br>hepatitis C caused 326,000, and hepatitis B caused 371,000. In the United States, more men die of cirrhosis than
<br> women.  The first known description of the condition is by Hippocrates in the 5th century BCE.  The word cirrhosis is <br>from Greek: "yellowish" and -osis  meaning "condition", describing the appearance of a <br>cirrhotic liver
