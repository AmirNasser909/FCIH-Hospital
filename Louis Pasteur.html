<h2 style="color:red">Synopsis</h2>
<p style="font-size:160% ">Born on December27, 1822, in Dole, France, Louis Pasteur discovered that microbes were
<br>
responsible for souring alcohol and came up with the process of pasteurization, where bacteria
<br>
is destroyed by heating beverages and then allowing them to cool. His work in germ theory also
<br>
led him and his team to create vaccinations for anthrax and rabies</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="color:red">First Major Contribution in Chemistry</h2>
<p style="font-size:160%">In 1849, Louis Pasteur was attempting to resolve a problem concerning the nature of tartaric
<br>
acid—a chemical found in the sediments of fermenting wine. Scientists were using the rotation of
<br>
polarized light as a means for studying crystals. When polarized light is passed through a solution
<br>
of dissolved tartaric acid, the angle of the plane of light is rotated. Pasteur observed that another
<br>
compound called paratartaric acid, also found in wine sediments, had the same composition as tartaric acid.
<br>
Most scientists assumed the two compounds were identical. However, Pasteur observed that paratartaric acid
<br>
did not rotate plane-polarized light. He deduced that although the two compounds had the same chemical 
<br>
composition, they must somehow have different structures.

Looking at the paratartaric acid under a microscope, Pasteur observed there were two different types of
<br>
tiny crystals.
<br>
Though they looked almost identical, the two were actually mirror images of each other. He separated the
<br>
two types of crystals into two piles and made solutions of each. When polarized light was passed through 
<br>
each, he discovered that both solutions rotated, but in opposite directions. When the two crystals were
<br>
together in the solution the effect of polarized light was canceled. This experiment established that just
<br>
studying the composition is not enough to understand how a chemical behaves. The structure and shape is
<br>
also important and led to the field of stereochemistry.</p>

<h2 style="color:red">Commercial Success<h2>
<p style="color:black">
In 1854, Pasteur was appointed professor of chemistry and dean of the science faculty at the University of Lille.
<br>
There, he worked on finding solutions to the problems with the manufacture of alcoholic drinks. Working with the germ
<br>
theory, which Pasteur did not invent but further developed through experiments and eventually convinced most of Europe
<br>
of its truth, he demonstrated that organisms such as bacteria were responsible for souring wine, beer and even milk.
<br>
He then invented a process where bacteria could be removed by boiling and then cooling liquid. He completed the first 
<br>
test on April 20, 1862. Today the process is known as pasteurization.
<br>
Shifting focus, in 1865, Pasteur helped save the silk industry. He proved that microbes were attacking healthy silkworm eggs,
<br>
causing an unknown disease, and that the disease would be eliminated if the microbes were eliminated. He eventually developed
<br>
a method to prevent their contamination and it was soon used by silk producers throughout the world.
<br>
Pasteur's first vaccine discovery was in 1879, with a disease called chicken cholera. After accidentally exposing chickens
<br>
to the attenuated form of a culture, he demonstrated that they became resistant to the actual virus. Pasteur went on to
<br>
extend his germ theory to develop causes and vaccinations for diseases such as anthrax, cholera, TB and smallpox.
<br>
In 1873, Pasteur was elected as an associate member of the Académie de Médecine. In 1882, the year of his acceptance
<br>
into the Académie Française, he decided to focus his efforts on the problem of rabies. On July 6, 1885, Pasteur
<br>
vaccinated Joseph Meister, a 9-year-old boy who had been bitten by a rabid dog. The success of Pasteur's vaccine
<br>
brought him immediate fame. This began an international fundraising campaign to build the Pasteur Institute in Paris,
<br>
which was inaugurated on November 14, 1888.</p>
